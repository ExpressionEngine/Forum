# Discussion Forum

The ExpressionEngine Discussion Forum Module allows you to create and manage a full-featured forum on your site. This includes everything from posting and replying to editing threads and private messaging other users. The Module also allows you to easily administer your forum both for setup and to create and assign Moderators and Administrators. You can even easily change the look and feel of your forum by simply applying another "theme" to it.
